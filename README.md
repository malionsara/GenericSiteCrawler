Please select GenericSiteCrawlerGUI as the start up project.

If there is a missing pacakage reference error, 
it's AngleSharp nuget package missing from GenericSiteCrawlerLibrary.

If you would like to have some quick tests, you can select GenericSiteCrawlerApp
as the start up project, this way the project will run on console.

Thank you for your time and I really hope you will like my work :)
